# skilleri
This is my first database project

I designed a database for an imaginary application.
Skilleri is an application that connects class instructors of dancing, yoga etc. with their customers.

This repository contains a Powerpoint file, that describes the project in Finnish, aswell as the sql files for queries and creation of tables.
